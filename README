wtgo
--------

This repository contains work-in-progress Go bindings for the WiredTiger
storage engine. This software is barely functional and likely has serious bugs.
Use at your own risk.

Requirements
--------
These bindings require WiredTiger 11.2.0+ installed locally to build. It's
tracking the WiredTiger development branch, so the API will not remain stable.
Eventually there may be a versioning system that tracks WiredTiger stable
releases.

Usage
--------
Check wtgo_test.go for example usage 

Motivation
--------
All existing bindings were quite old or out-of-date. WiredTiger has a neat API
and I wanted to try it out as an embedded database for fun.
